# Goal of this project
The main goal of this project is to follow a tutorial about building a virtual world of self-driving cars. The reason why is because I want to broaden my JavaScript knowledge, without having to use any libaries.

## Learning segments
These are the points that I am going to learn from this tutorial in smaller components. Since this is a complex project, these components will help to better understand what the project consist of and what I have learned.
- Building a spatial graph from scratch and creating an editor with a dynamic viewport.
- Understanding the mathematics and logic behind user-friendly interfaces in modern software.
- Generating road borders, buildings, and trees using geometry and creating a 3D illusion.
- Implementing road markings to prepare for advanced self-driving challenges.
- Enhancing the world editor for user convenience and maximizing auto-generated content.
- Loading real-world data from openstreetmap for city-based simulations.
- Creating a minimap for navigation in expansive worlds.
